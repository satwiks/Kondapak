<b>Family</b> 
<p>India for ages has had a prevailing tradition of the joint family system. It's a system under which even extended members of a family like one's parents, children, the children's spouses and their offspring, etc. live together. The elder-most, usually the male member is the head in the joint Indian family system who makes all important decisions and rules, whereas other family members abide by it. <p>
    Arranged marriages have the tradition in Indian society for centuries. Even today, overwhelming majority of Indians have their marriages planned by their parents and other respected family-members, with the consent of the bride and groom.Arranged matches were made after taking into account factors such as age, height, personal values and tastes, the backgrounds of their families (wealth, social standing) and their castes and the astrological compatibility of the couples' horoscopes.

<b>Festivals</b> 
<p>India, being a multi-cultural and multi-religious society, celebrates holidays and festivals of various religions. The three national holidays in India, the Independence Day, the Republic Day and the Gandhi Jayanti, are celebrated with zeal and enthusiasm across India. Popular religious festivals include the Hindu festivals of Diwali, Ganesh Chaturthi, Durga puja, Holi, Rakshabandhan,Ram Navami and Dussehra. Several harvest festivals, such as Sankranthi, Batukamma are also fairly popular. Islamic festivals, such Eid ul-Fitr, Eid al-Adha and Ramadan, are celebrated by Muslims across India. <p>
    <font style="color:#990000; font-family:Arial; font-weight:bold; font-size:14px;">Bonalu </font> festival begins with the Mahankali. On the festival day, women wear silk sarees and jewellery. Some tranced women dance with balancing pots (Bonam), to the rhythmic beats of drums in honour of the local Goddess.<p>

	It is believed that the Goddess comes back to her maternal home during Ashada Maasam, so people come to see her and bring offerings of food to show their love and affection, just as they would prepare a special meal when their own daughters visit them.<p>
    
<font style="color:#990000; font-family:Arial; font-weight:bold; font-size:14px;">Batukamma </font> is a spring festival celebrated by Hindu women of Telangana region in andhra Pradesh, India. This festival falls in the months of September/October called as Aswiyuja. The festival concludes two days before Dussera called as Durgashtami.<p>
The name Batukamma is given to a flower stack, arranged with seasonal flowers, in seven concentric layers, of potterâ€™s clay like a cone. It is also called as Bodemma.<p>

Batuku in Telugu means live/life, and Amma means mother, hence Batukamma, is celebrated for the glory of Gauri goddess (meaning fair or white) - the patron Goddess of womanhood.<p>

Women celebrate the festival dressed-up in traditional silk sarees, wear jewellery and girls wear a two-piece saree called as Langa oni. Later in the evening, they gather in large numbers with their batukammas in their locality near by Pond, place them in the middle and dance around them, synchronizing steps and claps in unison, and singing soul stirring Batukamma folk songs. after singing and dancing for hours, Batukammalu are taken to a lake r a pond and spend some more time singing and dancing after which they are set afloat gently in a lake or a pond nearby.<p>

This festival goes on for seven days and concludes on Durgastami. The main festival day is called Saddula Batukamma. On this day they celebrate into wee hours before leaving their Batukamma in water.Lakes floating with batukammas in the evenings is a treat to the eyes.<p>

<font style="color:#990000; font-family:Arial; font-weight:bold; font-size:14px;">Sri Rama Navami</font> is a Hindu festival dedicated to Lord Sri Rama that is celebrated across the country irrespective of the caste and creed. It is generally celebrated as the birth day of Lord Sri Rama coinciding with the ninth day (Navami thithi) of Chaitra Masa Sukla Paksha as per Hindu calendar.

On That Day they also perform Sita Rama Kalyanam (marriage of Lord Sri Rama and Goddess Sita). One such place where Sita Rama Kalyanam is performed on a grand scale on this day is at Kondapak in Andhra Pradesh .Devotees makes elaborate arrangements on this occasion and hundreds of people participate in this function.<p>

<font style="color:#990000; font-family:Arial; font-weight:bold; font-size:14px;">Ganesh Chaturthi </font>starts with the installation of these Ganesh statues in colorfully decorated homes and specially erected temporary structures mantapas (pandals) in every locality. The pandals are erected by the people or a specific society or locality or group by collecting monetary contributions. The mantapas are decorated specially for the festival, either by using decorative items like flower garlands, lights, etc or are theme based decorations, which depict religious themes or current events. The statues are worshiped with families and friends. On the 9th day, the statue is taken through the streets in a procession accompanied with dancing, singing, and fanfare to be immersed in a river or the sea symbolizing a ritual see-off of the Lord in his journey towards his abode in Kailash while taking away with him the misfortunes of his devotees. All join in this final procession shouting "Ganapathi Bappa Morya, Purchya Varshi Laukar ya" (O father Ganesha, come again early next year). After the final offering of coconuts, flowers and camphor is made, people carry the statue to the river to immerse it.<p>


<font style="color:#990000; font-family:Arial; font-weight:bold; font-size:14px;">Muharram (Peerla Panduga)</font> Hindus and Muslims will participate in the procession highlighting communal harmony and integration. This old tradition stands as a shining example of the glorious cultural heritage of Kondapak and communal harmony. 
Muharram (Peerla Panduga) is the first month of the Islamic calendar. It is one of the four sanctified months of the year. Fighting in this month is looked down upon and is sometimes put to the side in respect for Islam. Since the Islamic calendar is lunar, Muharram moves from year to year when compared with the Gregorian calendar.
