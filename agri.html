From a nation dependent on food imports to feed its population, Kondapak today is not only self-sufficient in grain production, but also has a substantial reserve and has of late started exporting appreciable quantities of rice, corn, sugar cane etc. The progress made by agriculture in the last few decades has been one of the biggest success stories of Kondapak village.<p>

Agriculture is the science and practice of cultivating of land, producing crops, and raising animals. Some of the earliest cultivated crops included Paddy, Cotton, Tobacco and Mirchi. The presence of larger scale, systematic cultivation often preceded or accompanied the rise of village and the formation of organized civilization.</div></td></tr>
