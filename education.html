<b>Education </b>is a system by which individuals gain knowledge. Applied knowledge is required to sustain lives. Without education there is no knowledge, and without knowledge and its application life cannot exist. Therefore we require education to sustain our lives.<p>

Education is a process of bringing up (young persons); the manner in which a person has been brought up with reference to social situation, kind of manners and habits acquired calling or employment prepared for, etc. In its technical sense education is the process by which society deliberately transmits its accumulated knowledge, skills and values from one generation to another through institutions. <p>
<span style="color: red"><strong>Institutions</strong>:</span><br>
    We have very good educational institutions in our Kondapak province from the nursery to engineering, these institutions made history in the process of creating skilled people. The products (pupils) came out these institutions are all over the world and there are the doctors, engineersâ€™ lawyers and lot of highly qualified people around the world from our Kondapak village, they are very special where ever they go. Yes the causes for these good products are the teachers, they are the one who imparts knowledge.<p>
    
<span style="color: red"><strong>Teachers</strong>:</span><br>
    Teaching is probably one of the noblest professions in the whole world. Teachers are responsible for our education. A great part of the knowledge we gained we owe to the teachers who have been part of our lives. Teachers educate and guide students to grow, become cultivated, and wise.<p>

Here we would like to put few words about our Kondapak teachers. Many teachers worked hard to educate the pupils though they were/are not working in Kondapak schools. Many retired teachers and lecturers are still giving free of coaching in the morning and evening times. This tradition is continuing since decades. Yes, they are the real heroes of our Kondapak village..
